## Hangman game
My project that is made for Estonian IT College in Fundamentals of Python course. It is written in Python 3

## Motivation
From the beginnig of my studying in IT College i wanted to write something in python. 
I decided to make a hangman game because i have never made any games.

## Dependencies
This project was made in PyCharm IDE. I haven't used any additional libraries. 
I decided to divede my code into 3 parts:
hangman(main file with methods), 
gui(graphical part of my game),
dictionary(you can put any words, that you want)
So,if you want to play in my game - make sure you have all of these files.
